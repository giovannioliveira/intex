<h2>TUGboat styles and information</h2>

<p>The <a href="/TUGboat/">TUGboat</a> macros are included in all major
TeX distributions, so most likely you don't have to do anything to
install them.  If you need or want the latest, it's available on <a
href="/ctan.html">CTAN</a>, <a href="#location">see below</a>.

<h3 id="template">Article template</h3>

<p>This <a href="sampleart.ltx">sample article template</a> also
includes a super-summary of some of the most commonly used features of
the TUGboat style.


<h3 id="tips">Quick tips for authors</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please keep source lines to <= 79 characters.  That is, if your
editor likes to do one line per paragraph without hard line breaks,
please try to configure it otherwise.  Failing that, we will rebreak
the source on receipt.

<li>Even today, 7-bit ASCII is by far the most reliable encoding for the
source text.  TeX control sequences are preferred to Unicode or
Latin&nbsp;N characters.  But if your source needs non-ASCII to be
readable, that's fine.

<li>The TUGboat style files have many predefined abbreviations; please
use them where possible.  The <a href="sampleart.ltx">sample article
template</a> lists some that are commonly used.

<li>Use <tt>\acro{WORD}</tt> for other words in ALL CAPS.

<li>Use <tt>\cs{foo}</tt> to output the control sequence <tt>\foo</tt>.

<li>Use <tt>\Dash</tt> instead of <tt>---</tt>.

<li>Footnotes <em>after</em> punctuation.

<li>Even better, avoid footnotes completely.  They complicate page
breaking and usually disturb reading.  References, especially, are
better put in a bibliography.  Abbreviations are better as a
parenthetical remark.  (&ldquo;Don't use footnotes in your books,
Don.&rdquo; &mdash;Jill Knuth.)  Nevertheless, if you feel you must have
footnotes, it's ok.

<li>Write an abstract.  Don't include bibliography references in the
abstract.

<li>Do not worry about figure placement, page breaks, column breaks,
etc., because they will almost certainly change during editing.

<li>TUGboat is produced entirely with pdf files, so do not worry about
dvi output, eps format for figures, etc.  On the other hand, if dvi
output is <i>needed</i> for your paper, that's fine.

<li>If you need to use OpenType/TrueType fonts with XeTeX/LuaTeX, that's
fine, but please do not use system font lookups; systems differ.
Instead, use filename lookups (see the <a
href="http://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec">fontspec</a> documentation if need
be, or we will help as needed).  Also, if the fonts are not part of TeX
Live, please say where we can get them.

<li>Do not use the word &ldquo;really&rdquo;.

</ul>


<h3 id="writing">General advice on content</h3>

<ul>
<li>Consider the topic from the point of view of an
    interested reader: if you weren't the author, what would you
    like to learn from the article?

<li>The length of an article should depend on the topic.
    The article should cover the chosen ground completely, leaving no
    major questions unanswered, but it should do so concisely.  Shorter
    articles are more likely to be read.  If in doubt, shoot for five
    pages or less.

<li>Don't worry overmuch about deadlines; there will always be another
    issue.  It's better to take enough time to do the best job than
    to hurry the work.

<li>If illustrations will aid comprehension, include them.

<li>Illustrations that truly require color can be printed in color.
    However, color pages are of course much more expensive to print.  So
    when color is not required, please check that your images degrade ok
    in black and white.  (Color versions can be posted on the web.)
    
<li>If you have questions, just ask.  That's what editors are for. 
</ul>

<h3 id="ctan">TUGboat macros on CTAN</h3>

<p>Both the plain and LaTeX TUGboat macros are included in <a
href="/texlive/">TeX Live</a> and <a
href="http://www.miktex.org">MiKTeX</a>, among other distributions, so
you almost certainly have them installed already if you have TeX at all.
But in case you want to check the latest versions, or just peruse
&hellip;

<p>On CTAN, plain TeX macros and user documentation are located in<br>
    <tt>/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib</tt>:
    <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/tugboat/">browse</a>,
    <a href="ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/tugboat.zip">zip</a>.

<p>LaTeX macros and user documentation are located in<br>
    <tt>/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tugboat</tt>:
    <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tugboat/">browse</a>,
    <a href="ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tugboat.zip">zip</a>.

<p>You must process <tt>tugboat.ins</tt> with LaTeX.  This will unpack
the files <tt>ltugboat.cls</tt> and others for your use.  Documentation
is contained in the same directory as the macros, in the file
<tt>ltubguid.ltx</tt> (and PDF).

<p>A ConTeXt style for TUGboat is available on request.


<h3 id="hyphenex">Hyphenation exception list</h3>

<p>TUGboat regularly publishes a hyphenation exception list for
U.S. English.  The full list is <a
href="http://ctan.org/pkg/hyphenex">on CTAN in machine-readable
form</a>, along with accompanying information.
